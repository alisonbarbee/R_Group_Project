## *The Data*

## *Australian Wildfires*

The maps show...

The faceted graphs show...

## *Notes*

Alison = map of the fire shapes in Australia 
- Australia map 
- use leaflet and create the icon as fire
- Create maps for each station in leaflet and send to Keke
- See if there is a way

- 'crosstalk' between the map and the table or we can put metadata on the 
prescribed burns vs a wildfire on the popup in the map

Kate = time series of rainfall and temperature at different stations 
- faceted plot based on stations
- hpow climate change has made things worse 


Keke = looking at scatter plot of long and lat of rainfall
- percipitation 
- table:
